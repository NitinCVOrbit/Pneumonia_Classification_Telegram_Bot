# 🫁 Pneumonia Classification Telegram Bot using Custom CNN

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a **Telegram Bot** that leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify chest X-ray images as either **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.

The bot receives chest X-ray images via Telegram and replies with the **predicted class** and the **confidence score**.

Built using a **custom CNN architecture**, this project demonstrates real-time medical image classification through an intuitive Telegram interface.
